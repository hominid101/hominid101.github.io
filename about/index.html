<p>
I am passionate about changing the market by bringing disruptive technologies.
</p>
<p>
Currently I head software development at Wave Computing, a startup building deep-learning acceleration systems that will catalyze machine-intelligence in the cloud by making future data centers 10x-100x more efficient. We work on algorithms and compilers for dataflow programming of thousands of processors.
</p>
<p>
Prior to Wave, I was a member of the startup team at Oasys Design Systems, where I managed the technical engagement that lead to a licensing agreement with Xilinx. Oasys’s RTL physical synthesis technology was shown to be 10x-60x faster than competition, and was used in Xilinx’s next generation FPGA implementation tools. Oasys was eventually acquired by Mentor Graphics.

<p>
I had been an early member of the startup team at Magma Design Automation, that brought industry’s first integrated RTL-to-GDSII silicon compilation system for designing deep sub-micron integrated circuits. Starting in a team of two people, I grew the team and led the development of Magma’s entire set of front-end and DFT tools. Magma became the fourth largest public EDA company in the world, and was eventually acquired by Synopsys.
</p>
<p>
At Cadence Design Systems, I was part of a research team that built one of the industry’s first formal equivalence-checking tools and demonstrated it in the Design Automation Conference. Since then equivalence checking has become the gold standard for logic verification of billion-transistor designs.
